// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible to COM components.
// If you need to access a type in this assembly from COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version - Increment this value every time you make change that is NOT back-compatible.
//      Minor Version - Increment this value every time you are adding new possibility. Reset it to "0" in case you change the Major Version.
//      Build Number  - Increment this value every time you make change.
//      Revision      - Here the VCS revision number is the best choise I think.
